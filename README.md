# Background
For anyone that hasn't read Warriors by Erin Hunter. Warriors is about a group of cats that live in the wild. You can look up the series at warriorcats.com if you interested in the series.
#Motivation
At one point of time there was a conduct your name with StarClan on their web page. What you would do is input your name and hometown and it will give you a warrior name. After they took it off, I decided to make my own program to make warrior names.
#Instructions
WarriorNameCode can be copy to a code blocks and then run it.

When you open the program it will ask for a name and hometown. You donâ€™t have to enter that data just enter at least two letters into each one. The program will do everything else.
#Tip
Try out friend names or use random words to find tons of interesting names.
