# Background
For anyone that hasn't read Warriors by Erin Hunte, Warriors is about a group of cats that live in the wild. You can look up the series at warriorcats.com if you interested in the series.
#Motovation
At one point of time there was a "conduct your name with StarClan" generator on the Warrior Cats web page. What you do is input your name and hometown, then it will give you a warrior name. Since it is now removed, I decided to make my own program to make warrior names.
#Instructions
Compile the WarriorNameCode and enjoy!

When you open the program it will ask for a name and hometown. You donâ€™t have to enter that data just enter at least two letters into each one. The program will do everything else.
#Tip
Try out a friend's name or use random words to find tons of interesting names.
